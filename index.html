                            This article is not some magical spell kind of an essay that makes you devoid of the curse
                            known as "Procrastination",
                            so it is better to keep aside your expectations and enjoy this small yet interesting post.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many a times in our lives we get bright ideas such as, an idea for the next unicorn startup,
                            a solution for the
                            traffic problem in Bangalore, or even smaller scale ideas like, garbage disposal problem in
                            your house, keeping
                            the house clean, organising ourselves, etc.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="blog-subheading">The Plan</h4>
                        <p>It contains two parts: Discipline and a Goal.</p>

                        <h5 class="blog-section-title">Discipline:</h5>
                        <p>
                            Make a plan, as in, what is the task to be done, where it has to be done, by when should it
                            be done. Pay very keen
                            attention to the details in your planning, also don't plan something that would be so
                            ambitious in nature such that
                            it would fail even before you embark on executing that task. Fix a place for you to complete
                            your task, a place with
                            least amount of disturbance and maximum availability of resources required to complete your
                            task. As in, for a coding
                            task, choose a quiet room which has a good seating area and has easy access to WiFi,
                            beverages or anything that would
                            keep you refreshed for the whole time period of the task.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Make a time table such that you should be doing the task on a regular basis and the margin
                            for the distraction to
                            interfere should be minimum to nil. Like, each session with your task should in periods of
                            an hour or two, not greater
                            than that, because anything longer than that would wear off your attention span and removes
                            the oomph factor from the
                            work you are doing.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="blog-section-title">Goal:</h5>
                        <p>
                            Set a goal, a very clear and a precise one. It is extremely important to set one, because if
                            you don't, then you
                            would be wondering the highways of your daily life without knowing your destination.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After setting a goal, plan each and every step of the path that you would take to achieve
                            that goal. Also don't plan
                            too ahead of time, as many factors could change along the way. So an easy method is to plan
                            very well, as in, take into
                            account every detail involved, every challenge expected in the very next step you are going
                            to take in the process. Then
                            plan with an increased amount of abstraction to the latter parts of journey, those phases
                            should be unravelled and details
                            of it planned as and when you near it. This makes the journey less scary and turns it into a
                            joyful ride. So follow the
                            philosophy of "One step at a time".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion I would like to say that along with the above two key points, the one thing
                            that would keep you going is
                            "Perseverance", don't let anyone or anything come in between you and your end goal. I know
                            it is easier said than done,
                            but it all comes down to how badly you want to achieve that goal. I might say whatever in
                            this post, but it is you that
                            matters and it is you that decides whether to achieve it or not. Lucky are those who have
                            someone to keep pushing them
                            towards their goal, but most of us don't have that luxury, so your will power is the only
                            currency that will help you in
                            reaching your goal.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="blog-subheading">Personal Note:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is my first article online. I faced the same problems that are described above and I
                            followed the above points to
                            get started with the journey. I have not yet reached the destination, but I will eventually.
                            Writing an article online
                            has always been one of the things on my bucket list. For various reasons such as lack of
                            interest to create and set up a
                            personal blog website, lack of money to buy a custom domain, and many such things were
                            stopping me. But I decided enough
                            was enough, and I searched for a platform that would be good to start writing. I found
                            medium that matched all my
                            requirements and ended up writing this blog. I hope the amount of enthusiasm with which I
                            wrote reaches at least one
                            reader if not all, and he/she can achieve whatever they set their mind on.
